# Pheromone-Delivery-Drone

## Overview
There is an insect called the naval orangeword that is infecting the almonds on a farm. We want to find a way to mitigate the pest damage quickly, since there is an increase in crop damage.

There are insect surveillance sensors in place to collect information about the insects, but the methods to eliminate them are expensive. The solution found was to use Pheromone-Based Mating Distribution (PBMD), which involves applying pheromone paste with a drone to confuse male insects from finding females. This approach is safer for the environment and more effective.

The problem we are trying to solve is that the drone's current flight time is too high, resulting in wasted battery. Therefore, our goal is to minimize the lenght of the flight path. Given the list of locations that the drone carrying the pheromone paste must visit. We will determine the shortest route that the drone needs to take to complete its task and return to its starting/charging point.
